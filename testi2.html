        <p>Bo2 Hmmm A great teacher The best I have ever seen You broke chemistry and physics down to me when I was having a hard time understanding what I was being taught at school Out of your busy schedule, you always find time to tutor me which really appreciate There's no way I would write about my academic success without your name appearing over and over From my tender age, you made me take a strong liking to mathematics I have told a lot of people about how good you are and how you have been teaching me a lot I'm super happy and proud that I have someone like you in my life Thank you so much sir</p>

        <h1>Fatia Yakub</h1>
        <p>Thank you for all on the time and attention you've given me sir. It made such a difference in my academic and grades. I've changed in so many wonderful ways under your instruction. No other teacher has ever invested so much time in me, and I am truly thankful and grateful When it comes to teaching, no one can compete with you sir. You're the best teacher that I have ever had or that anyone could possibly hope to have. The only reason why I can now face the real world and know that I can conquer it is because you gave me confidence and knowledge. Thank you!</p>

        <h1>Mofe Osibanjo</h1>
        <p>Mathematics, Chemistry, English, and Physics teacher I personally know. You wear so many hats of knowledge, sometimes I wonder how you know and remember the things you do. Your teachings were very crucial to my success in Jamb. I believe you went over at least 10 years of past questions with me in all the subjects I mentioned above and by the grace of God combined with some hard work and you as my lesson teacher scored 304 in the exam. Honestly, could have done way better if I studied more but your notes were majorly all I went over on the days prior to my exam. I honestly cannot quantify how much of an impact you have made in my life not just academically but also morally, I met you as a lazy child who struggled in Math, who always questioned his academic abilities and although I still get impostor syndrome from time to time, I left you success-driven, Godly and the intelligent young man who by God's grace and hard work is studying engineering at McMaster University. Thank you once again Sir â€¦ thank you, and I pray that you and your household will forever prosper in Jesus name. Amen.</p>

        <h1>Obinna Ekwealor</h1>
        <p>Mr Tola I know taking me during your spare time isn't easy because you have a very busy schedule I remember when I was due to right jamb, On a Sunday I remember the very little time he took me for it wasn't even up to 2 hours he taught me on salts, naming of organic compounds and oxidation and reduction it didn't even take me much time for me to grab everything he said. He gave me comprehensive notes from his head very intelligent man and what he told me that day. virtually all came out in my jamb and my highest score was chemistry both in Neco and jamband till this day still remember what he taught me. Mr. TOLA taught me to love chemistry more and more See let me just tell you if you have Waec and Neco physics or chemistry practical run to Mr TOLA let him teach you and Jot down the important points all the titration calculations he gives you study them at least out of the 5 like 3 will come out</p>
